## Main run

After having run all of FESetup the simulation input can be generated by running:   
```bash setupall.sh```   
followed by    
```bash run1all.sh```
Adjustments will have to be made in these scripts to fit each indivual cluster

Alternatively all input files can be found in ```perturbation_inputs```.
